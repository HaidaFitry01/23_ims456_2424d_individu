    </p><h6><center>WATCHING KDRAMA</center></h6>
            I really love to watch kdrama. This is because K-Dramas usually present creative and brilliant twists. The mystery that drives the show is always interesting.

    </p><h6><center>BAKING</center></h6>
        I have other hobbies, no doubt, but none can compare to my love for baking.  I baked my first cheesecake for the family and got plenty of positive feedback from my mum, sisters, and my dad too.

    </p><h6><center>TRAVEL</center></h6>
        My favorite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel such as by car, by train, and by plane. Usually, I travel with my family or with my friends. Most of all I like to travel by car and spend a little time at different places.
